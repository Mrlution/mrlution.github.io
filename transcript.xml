            <description><![CDATA[<p>The world of high end perfume is surprisingly lucrative, considering that scent is often the most ignored of our senses. But one can’t judge a scent solely by the brand and shape of the bottle. With the right amount of attention, perfume can be a key to a whole olfactory world.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[A Fantasy of Fashion: Articles of Interest #7]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>In the wake of World War II, the government of France commissioned its most prominent designers to create a collection of miniature fashion dolls. It might seem like an odd thing to fund, but the fantasy of high fashion inspired hope in postwar Paris. These dolls also forever changed the curator who discovered them almost 40 years later, in a strange museum perched on a cliff in rural Washington state</p>

            <title><![CDATA[The Natural Experiment]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>Summer is normally cruise ship season in Southeast Alaska. Starting in late April ships filled with tourists sail up the inside passage, stopping at little coastal port towns. One of the popular destinations along this route is Glacier Bay. It’s this spectacular bay filled with icebergs, sea otters, and lots and lots of humpback whales. The National Park Service regulates how many cruise ships can come in and out of the bay, but still, the humpbacks that are there in the summer have to live alongside the roaring of boat engines. Michelle Fournet is an acoustic ecologist at Cornell, and she says that these sea animals change their behavior when the waters get noisy.</p>
<figure id="attachment_32093" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-32093" style="width: 600px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img class="size-medium wp-image-32093" src="https://99percentinvisible.org/app/uploads/2020/04/Kaboom_1-600x400.jpg" alt width="600" height="400" srcset="https://99percentinvisible.org/app/uploads/2020/04/Kaboom_1-600x400.jpg 600w, https://99percentinvisible.org/app/uploads/2020/04/Kaboom_1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://99percentinvisible.org/app/uploads/2020/04/Kaboom_1-728x485.jpg 728w, https://99percentinvisible.org/app/uploads/2020/04/Kaboom_1.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-32093" class="wp-caption-text">An aerial view of Margerie Glacier. The glacier begins high in the mountains and meanders down the valleys like a river of ice. NPS Photo</figcaption></figure>
<p>Every summer Fournet travels to Gacier Bay to drop a hydrophone in the water and listen in on what the whales are saying, and how it’s affected by ship noise. This year she was preparing for her annual trip to Southeast Alaska when the Covid19 shutdowns were announced. Although it meant that her research trip was canceled she realized it was an incredible opportunity. For the first time in decades, the ocean would be quiet for an entire summer, “For somebody like me as a researcher, is that we have the opportunity to listen to undisturbed behavior for the first time,” explains Fournet.</p>
<figure id="attachment_32094" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-32094" style="width: 421px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img class=" wp-image-32094" src="https://99percentinvisible.org/app/uploads/2020/04/304D39D1-1DD8-B71C-07897C55389FE615-600x450.jpg" alt width="421" height="316" srcset="https://99percentinvisible.org/app/uploads/2020/04/304D39D1-1DD8-B71C-07897C55389FE615-600x450.jpg 600w, https://99percentinvisible.org/app/uploads/2020/04/304D39D1-1DD8-B71C-07897C55389FE615-300x225.jpg 300w, https://99percentinvisible.org/app/uploads/2020/04/304D39D1-1DD8-B71C-07897C55389FE615-728x546.jpg 728w, https://99percentinvisible.org/app/uploads/2020/04/304D39D1-1DD8-B71C-07897C55389FE615.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 421px) 100vw, 421px" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-32094" class="wp-caption-text">The observer was stationed inside a gated area at the center of the bow of the cruise ship.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Usually, Fournet relies on quiet periods in an </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">individual day</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to try and understand how ship noise changes whale behavior… if she’s lucky she’ll get 6-7 hours of silence… but now the ocean was about to experience months of quiet. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fournet is now all set to record an entire summer of whale sounds in strangely quiet seas, “T</span>his is the first time in human history that we’ve been able to listen to truly quiet behavior,” she says. <i>“</i>We will finally get a baseline for what the ocean sounds like. In the absence of human activity<i>.”</i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In general, the coronavirus shutdowns have been terrible for academic research. Trips have been canceled, labs have shut down, and long-running experiments have been interrupted. But there are some researchers, like Fournet, for whom the shutdowns have provided a unique opportunity—a whole new data set, a chance to gather new information, or to look at information in a new way. In science, the term natural experiment refers to an experiment that happens outside of the lab, where a variable out in the world changes in ways that allows you to do research that hadn’t seemed possible in controlled settings. And so, this week, we’re bringing you stories very different academic fields, about researchers who are using this bizarre, tragic moment to learn something new about the world. </span>

<h2>Air Pollution</h2>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jalandhar" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Jalandhar</a> is a city in Northern India, in the state of Punjab. Like all Indian cities Jalandhar has been in lockdown, with everybody inside their homes, but a couple of weeks ago there was this bright sunny day and the residents of the city went outside onto their roofs, and what they saw was this amazing view of snow-capped mountains—the Himalayas. And this view was celebrated all over social media. There are tons of pictures of these mountains on Instagram, and TikTok videos of people zooming in on these crisp snow-capped peaks.</p>
<div class="twitter-container embed-container">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data- data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">What nature really is and how we screwed it up. </p>
<p>This is Dhauladhar mountain range of Himachal, visible after 30 yrs, from Jalandhar (Punjab) after pollution drops to its lowest level. This is approx. 200 km away straight. <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Lockdown21?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#Lockdown21</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/MotherNature?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#MotherNature</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Global?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#Global</a> healing. <a href="https://t.co/cvZqbWd6MR" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/cvZqbWd6MR</a></p>
<p>— Diksha Walia (@Deewalia) <a href="https://twitter.com/Deewalia/status/1246080484813058048?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">April 3, 2020</a></p></blockquote>
<p></p></div>
<p>This was a big deal because many people were seeing these mountains for the first time. Raghu Karnad wrote about this phenomenon for the <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/news/dispatch/the-coronavirus-offers-a-radical-new-vision-for-indias-cities-pollution" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">New Yorker</a> and he says that because of air pollution the mountains have been completely obscured for decades. Karnad says that locals seemed to think the last time these mountains had been visible had been around 30 years ago.</p>
<p>Jalandhar is a dramatic example, but in cities all across India people are experiencing exceptionally clean air. Air pollution is normally a huge problem in India, and not just an aesthetic one. “The WHO had an estimate that 100,000 Indian children had died that year from a particular type of particulate found in air pollution,” explains Karnad, <span class="ddq below">“Indians are dying and being made sick in huge numbers, numbers that are almost too large to process.”</span></p>
<p>Raghu Karnad says that there’s this sense in India that the problem is almost so big that it can’t be solved. But seeing the vast improvement in air quality because of COVID-19 has made people rethink that, “And that’s what makes this moment so extraordinary. Is that we fixed this problem without intending to,” says Karnad.</p>
<figure id="attachment_32070" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-32070" style="width: 600px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img class="size-medium wp-image-32070" src="https://99percentinvisible.org/app/uploads/2020/04/5543835085_fb0b017685_o-600x401.jpg" alt width="600" height="401" srcset="https://99percentinvisible.org/app/uploads/2020/04/5543835085_fb0b017685_o-600x401.jpg 600w, https://99percentinvisible.org/app/uploads/2020/04/5543835085_fb0b017685_o-300x200.jpg 300w, https://99percentinvisible.org/app/uploads/2020/04/5543835085_fb0b017685_o-728x486.jpg 728w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-32070" class="wp-caption-text">View of West of Delhi.

<p>The shutdowns have also been an incredible to researchers who study air pollution and try to show where pollution is coming from. Researchers like <a href="http://www.urbanemissions.info/about/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sarath Guttikunda</a>. Guttikunda says that in their work they are always looking to understand the baseline air quality, like what a clean air scenario even looks like. Usually, they use rainy days to do this, but the problem with rain is that it doesn’t last. “When it rains, it’s clean for one day and then the build-up starts again. But what we are seeing here is a sustained period of low numbers.” And so this shutdown feels like the entire country is running an experiment for him… a forced experiment that shows you what happens if you turn many of the major sources of pollution down basically to zero.</p>
<div class="video-container embed-container"><iframe title="India’s nationwide coronavirus lockdown is doing wonders for air quality" width="356" height="200" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/OzUc7tB6viI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>
<p>Having this extended period of clean air is also allowing them to do more fine-tuned research experiments. Some of those experiments are chemistry experiments looking at particular pollutants like ozone. But they’re also trying to do a forensic accounting of where all this pollution is coming from. <span style="font-weight: 400;">Because there’s actually a lot of confusion about that. And a big question people have is: is the pollution being generated inside the city, by things like cars, and trash burning and dirty cook stoves? Or is it floating in from outside sources, things like power plants and heavy industry outside the city, or farmers in the countryside who burn their fields before they replant.  All of those sources are contributing to the problem but the uncertainty has allowed cities to throw up their hands and say this isn’t a problem we can solve. </span> It allows people in power to pass the buck of responsibility.</p>
<p>One of the goals of Guttikunda’s research is to use this period to show how much of the pollution that a city experiences are coming from those outside sources, and how much of it is generated locally, from things like traffic. He has found that at least 50-70% of the pollution in a city like Delhi was coming from sources inside the city, meaning that the cities could do a lot more to clean up the air.</p>

<p>But it is possible for big cities to change. If you look at Beijing before the 2008 Olympics, air quality was one of the most toxic in the world. The city implemented restrictions to try to clean up the air quality before the games and it worked. And after the games ended, citizens of Beijing didn’t want to go back to the poor air quality of before, so they pushed the government to control pollution.</p>

<p>One revealing aspect of COVID-19 is that it showed that in dire circumstances, we are able to change our habits and sacrifice in order to address a crisis. The challenge is determining which crises are worth implementing extreme measures. A pandemic is clearly a public health problem, but air quality is also a matter of life and death. The World Health Organization says that as many as 4.6 million people die a year due to air pollution. The reason we under-react to threats like air pollution probably has to do with the fact that many of them have disproportionate impacts on poor people. If you have money and you live in a city like Delhi you can take an Uber from your air-conditioned apartment to your air-conditioned office job. But there are millions of people who walk or ride their bikes to get around and shop in open-air markets. For those people, returning to “normal” levels of air pollution would be deadly. Raghu Karnad hopes that now that Indians have experienced weeks of blue skies, they will be moved to demand cleaner air all year long. “We have to hope that everyone can be brought around to realizing the necessity of collective action just the way everyone has been brought around to realizing that with coronavirus.”</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>Stories inspired by two people from the world of architecture and design we’ve lost due to COVID.</p>
<p>No matter which James Bond actor is your favorite, it’s undeniable that the Sean Connery films had the best villains. There’s Blofeld, who turned cat-stroking into a thing that super-villains do, and then there’s Goldfinger—Bond’s flashiest nemesis. Fun fact: the author of the James Bond books, Ian Fleming, named Goldfinger for a real person—an architect by the name of Ernő Goldfinger, who made giant, hulking, austere concrete buildings. Fleming disliked these buildings so intensely that he immortalized their architect as a villain in pop culture.</p>
<div class="video-container embed-container"><iframe title="Goldfinger Movie CLIP - I Expect you To Die (1964) HD" width="356" height="200" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Mx9z99YJ_7s?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>
<p>And Fleming wasn’t the only critic. Goldfinger’s buildings were decreed “soulless.” Inhabitants claimed to suffer health problems and depression from spending time inside them. Some of Goldfinger’s buildings were vacated because occupants found them so ugly. Yet, architects praised Goldfinger’s buildings. His Trellick tower, which was once threatened with demolition, has been awarded landmark status.</p>

<p>This divide—this hatred from the public and love from designers and architects, tends to be the narrative around buildings like Goldfinger’s. Which is to say, gigantic, imposing buildings made of concrete.</p>
<p>Some people refer to this building style as “Brutalist architecture,” but Brutalism is a big, broad label that’s used inconsistently in architecture, and architects tend to disagree on a precise definition of the word. Furthermore, the word “brutalism” has intense connotations, even though it’s not actually related to “brutality.” The word comes from the French “b<span style="font-weight: 400;">é</span>ton brut,” which means raw concrete.</p>

<p>Lots of folks, beyond the creator of James Bond, love to hate these concrete buildings. Their aesthetic can conjure up associations with bomb shelters, soviet-era, or “third-world” construction, but as harsh as it looks, concrete is an utterly optimistic building material.</p>
<p>Around the 1920s, concrete was seen as being the material that would change the world.  The material seemed boundless—readily available in vast quantities, and concrete sprang up everywhere—on bridges, tunnels, highways, sidewalks, and of course, massive buildings. Concrete has become the second-most consumed product in the world. The only thing we consume more of than concrete is water.</p>

<p>Concrete presented the most efficient way to house huge numbers of people, and government programs all over the world loved it—particularly Soviet Russia, but also later in Europe and North America.</p>
<p>Philosophically, concrete was seen as humble, capable, and honest—exposed in all its rough glory, not hiding behind any paint or layers. Concrete structures were erected all over the world as housing projects, courthouses, schools, churches, hospitals—and city halls.</p>

<p>In the late 1950s and early 60s, Boston was plagued by a loss of manufacturing jobs and white flight to the suburbs. For decades the Massachusetts capital had the highest property taxes in the nation and almost no new development. <span style="line-height: 1.5;">So Boston set an agenda to make the city great again by erecting big, soaring, modern buildings made of concrete. And, t</span><span style="line-height: 1.5;">hough some of these buildings were celebrated, others were despised. </span></p>

<p>When Boston City Hall was built in 1968, critics were put off by the concrete style. It was called “alienating” and “cold.” And since it was a government building, this criticism became impossible to remove from politics. Boston city hall became a political pawn as mayors and city council members vied for public support with promises to tear it down.</p>
<div class="video-container embed-container"><iframe title="Tear Down City Hall" width="267" height="200" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Hzb66Spg-Do?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>
<p>But tearing down Boston City Hall has never come to pass. Doing so would take an incredible amount of effort and money. And so, government officials have largely chosen to ignore the building. This “active neglect,” happens with a lot of concrete buildings—they are intentionally unrenovated and uncared for. Which only makes the building more ugly, and then more hated, and then more ignored. It’s a vicious cycle wherein the public hate of a building feeds itself.</p>

<p>When people built these mammoth concrete structures, no one really thought about maintenance, because they seemed indestructible. In the early days of concrete people assumed it was an everlasting material that wouldn’t require any further attention. This has not proven true. But, it can be hard to tell <em>when</em> concrete needs repairing since its decay is not visible on the surface.</p>
<p>Concrete deteriorates chemically, from the inside out. Part of this has to do with the metal rebar reinforcements that help to hold up most concrete buildings. The rebar can rust, and the rust can cause the concrete to fracture.</p>

<p>But despite their unpopularity, tearing down these concrete structures is probably not the answer. The process is costly and wasteful. We can adapt these buildings to make them greener, more appealing places to be. And the best way to break the cycle of active neglect may be to love these concrete brutes in all their hulking glory. As with any art form—whether opera or painting or literature—the more you know about it the more you appreciate it. This is especially true of concrete buildings.</p>
<p>Architecture students appreciate them because they know that concrete requires a great deal of skill and finesse to work with. Every little detail has to be calculated out in advance because once the concrete is poured, there’s no going back to make adjustments.</p>
<p>Aside from the interesting design challenges concrete poses, the material itself can be subtly beautiful.</p>

<p>We call the city a “concrete jungle” to talk about the artificiality of the urban landscape, but concrete can actually be a very natural expression of the environment. What we think of as a homogenous texture is actually rich and diverse, when you consider it closely.</p>
<p>Concrete’s color and texture can be dictated by local climate, local earth, and local rock. Concrete can also be an expression of local style and custom. For example, British concrete has big, thick textured chunks of rock, while Japanese concrete is fine and smooth.</p>

<p>But the beauty of concrete architecture might be the most apparent when you can observe the buildings like pieces of sculpture—without having to actually live and work in them. Which brings in concrete’s surprising ally—photography.</p>

<p>Concrete looks good in photographs. It provides a neutral background to bring out people’s skin tones, or the color of their clothing. Fashion photographers discovered this first, but in recent years, pockets of the internet started to appreciate these concrete buildings.</p>

<p>Photography is allowing a new audience to appreciate these buildings for their strong lines, their crisp shadows, and increasingly, the idealism they embody.</p>
<p>In the words of Adrian Forty, author of <a href="http://press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/distributed/C/bo13232846.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Concrete and Culture</em></a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>[Concrete buildings] represent a set of ideas about the state of the world and what the future was imagined to be that we want to preserve. We should remember what people were thinking 50 years ago. If we tear these buildings down, we will lose all of that.</p></blockquote>

<p>Back in the 1960s, Victorian-style buildings were considered hideous and impossible to repair. We were tearing batches of Victorians down to erect big concrete buildings. But some Victorians were saved—and today, some of them are considered treasures.</p>

<p>Concrete architecture now finds itself at an inflection point: too outdated to be modern, too young to be classic. And a small, but growing band of architects, architecture enthusiasts, and preservationists, would like us to just wait a bit and see.</p>
<p>Maybe, with a little time, we’ll come around to love these hulking concrete brutes.</p>
<h2>Coda</h2>
<p>We’ve lost quite a few people in the design world since the beginning of the pandemic due to COVID-19. One of them was <a href="https://archinect.com/news/article/150191435/michael-mckinnell-co-designer-of-boston-s-brutalist-city-hall-dies-from-covid-19" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Michael McKinnell</a>, co-designer of Boston’s Brutalist City Hall, and another voice who is gone too early was <a href="http://www.sorkinstudio.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Michael Sorkin</a>. Sorkin was an architect and the Village Voice architecture critic in the 80s. He brought a totally new kind of approach to writing about buildings, one that focused on people and politics.</p>
<p>We spoke with design critic at Curbed, Alexandra Lange, about Sorkin’s work, and Roman Mars reads excerpts from one of his works called <a href="https://www.readingdesign.org/250-things" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Two Hundred and Fifty Things an Architect Should Know.</a></p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>In January, reporter Rebecca Kanthor set out to travel across central China from her home base in Shanghai, making her way to her in-laws home for Chinese New Year. As she walked out the door and put a location into her GPS app on her phone in a robotic voice instructing her to “Please wear a mask if you’re going out. Be safe.”</p>

<audio class="wp-audio-shortcode" id="audio-31830-1" preload="none" style="width: 100%;" controls="controls"><source type="audio/wav" src="https://99percentinvisible.org/app/uploads/2020/04/Sound1-gpsapp.wav?_=1"><a href="https://99percentinvisible.org/app/uploads/2020/04/Sound1-gpsapp.wav">https://99percentinvisible.org/app/uploads/2020/04/Sound1-gpsapp.wav</a></audio></p>
<p>A week later when she returned home to Shanghai, the change was even more drastic. Anyone who ventured outside was wearing a mask. There were public service posters all over reminding people to wear masks. Face masks seem like such an obvious response in the face of an epidemic but are more commonly worn in China and other countries in East Asia than in the West. Around the world, there’s no doubt that this simple innovation has saved countless lives.

<h2>The Great Manchurian Plague</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over 100 years ago, China was the scene of another devastating epidemic called the <a href="https://yalebooks.yale.edu/book/9780300183191/great-manchurian-plague-1910-1911" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Manchurian Plague of 1910</a>. Back then, Manchuria was a contested territory—Russia, China, and Japan all claimed it was theirs and even called it the “cockpit of Asia.” But in 1910 this contested territory became the site of an incredibly deadly outbreak of plague. The mortality rate was so high that 95% or more of those that were infected died within just a few days of contracting it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://www.infectiousdisease.cam.ac.uk/directory/cl537@cam.ac.uk" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Christos Lynteris</a> is a medical anthropologist at the University of St. Andrews in the UK. He says that at the time photos of that outbreak in Manchuria were seen in newspapers around the world. “Photography played a key role in establishing this idea of a global outbreak or allow outbreak which is spreading across the globe,” explains Lynteris. Masks had been used in a clinical setting as early as 1897, but not systematically by the general public during an epidemic.</span></p>
<figure id="attachment_31849" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-31849" style="width: 362px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img class=" wp-image-31849" src="https://99percentinvisible.org/app/uploads/2020/04/Wu_Lien-teh_-_c._1910%E2%80%931915-600x834.jpg" alt width="362" height="503" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-31849" class="wp-caption-text">Dr. Wu Lien-teh (1879-1960) via United States Library of Congress</figcaption></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That all changed in Manchuria because of a doctor named <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wu_Lien-teh" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Wu Lien-teh</a>. Wu was a young Chinese-Malaysian doctor who had gone abroad to study medicine in Europe, in Germany, and France and the UK. The Qing Dynasty government called him in to lead the Chinese efforts against the plague, and was immediately greeted with disdain from his Russian, Japanese, British, and French counterparts in the medical field. But he was a brilliant scientist and quickly deduced that this was <a href="https://www.doh.wa.gov/Emergencies/BePreparedBeSafe/Diseases/PneumonicPlague" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pneumonic plague</a>, meaning it was airborne and spread through droplets in the air. At the time, most of the experts thought the plague was being spread by rats. Wu Lien-teh became convinced that the plague bacteria was spreading through the air, which he was right about! Based on that theory he made a fairly simple suggestion that people should start covering their mouth and nose with face masks. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wu believed that all of his medical staff, as well as the general public, should wear masks, but other doctors wouldn’t listen to him possibly because of his young age and race. One French doctor named Gérald Mesny openly antagonized him and refused to wear his mask. Soon after, Mesny caught the plague and died vindicating Wu’s theory. After Mesny’s death, everyone began wearing Wu’s mask. People began photographing it and it became a symbol of medical success and the plague ended after 7 months. The government implemented a lot of epidemic practices that we still see today—people began masks, quarantining patients, and cutting off travel to limit exposure.</span></p>

<h2>The 1918 Influenza</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Eight years later, when the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/flu/pandemic-resources/1918-pandemic-h1n1.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">1918 Flu Epidemic</a> hit, people remembered Wu’s mask and it started to be seen and adopted across the world. The acceptance of wearing masks really varied depending on where you were during the time, but it wasn’t a widespread practice. </span></p>
<figure id="attachment_31850" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-31850" style="width: 600px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img class="size-medium wp-image-31850" src="https://99percentinvisible.org/app/uploads/2020/04/1482px-1918_flu_outbreak-600x486.jpg" alt width="600" height="486" srcset="https://99percentinvisible.org/app/uploads/2020/04/1482px-1918_flu_outbreak-600x486.jpg 600w, https://99percentinvisible.org/app/uploads/2020/04/1482px-1918_flu_outbreak-300x243.jpg 300w, https://99percentinvisible.org/app/uploads/2020/04/1482px-1918_flu_outbreak-728x589.jpg 728w, https://99percentinvisible.org/app/uploads/2020/04/1482px-1918_flu_outbreak.jpg 1482w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-31850" class="wp-caption-text">Demonstration at the Red Cross Emergency Ambulance Station in Washington, D.C., during the influenza pandemic of 1918.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After the pandemic ended in 1920, wearing masks fell into obscurity in the US mostly because the country did not experience many deadly epidemics in the country, but in China, there was never an opportunity to forget because of the amount of outbreaks and wars. As Lynteris explains, “In China, you have a continuity of the use of the mask. So the mask story does not end in 1911 or 1918. It continues through several other outbreaks in the 20s, in the 30s. And then in Mao’s China after 1949.” Not only that, the medical mask plays an important role in public health campaigns and in propaganda.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A lot of people would say that wearing a mask is a “cultural” thing in China which is true in a way, but </span>Vivian Huang, a historian at the Shanghai Library, <span style="font-weight: 400;">says that they only became “normal” in China because they were required by the state. Wearing masks was promoted through propaganda posters, in the newspapers, and various other public health campaigns. She says that the adoption of masks was actually a slow process that needed to be learned.</span></p>
<h2>The New Normal</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By the time the SARS epidemic hit China in 2003 the face mask had become pretty common, and people by this point already knew what to do. Huang says it really has taken Chinese people 100 years to get to this point of acceptance of wearing masks during an infectious disease outbreak and now to the point when people just wear it when they’ve got a cold to protect others. It’s just normal practice whether you need to wear them during polluted days, or to keep warm. In the East, one wouldn’t feel like others would discriminate against them for choosing to wear one… but that has been a different story in the US because lots of Asian Americans feel worried about wearing masks because the culture of masks is so different in the United States. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lynteris thinks there’s something else going on in the West because masks are seen as racialized and associated with China, which leads to xenophobic behavior. ‘You have this phenomenon [that] some journalists call “mask-ophobia,” which is basically an attribute of sinophobia […] people who look Chinese or who look Asian being attacked on the streets of London […] because they’re wearing masks.” Lynteris says this kind of insidious racism isn’t even recognized by most people. </span></p>
<div class="video-container embed-container"><iframe title="Asian Americans see racism, discrimination amid coronavirus panic" width="356" height="200" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Vc7y7TQe_Dg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But Huang and Lynteris say that it’s the very opposite in China. A mask is a welcome sight because people feel it shows that the person wearing the mask cares about others.</span></p>
<div class="video-container embed-container"><iframe title="Gloria Estefan - Put On Your Mask!" width="356" height="200" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ygiDoiu4U08?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wearing a mask is an act of protecting yourself, but more importantly, protecting the people around you. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">It provides a sense of solidarity—that we’re all in this together.</span></p>

            <title><![CDATA[Unsheltered in Place]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>In the aftermath of a sudden disaster, people come together to help, but everything changes when the disaster is ongoing — and even more so when physically coming together poses medical risks both for communities that need assistance and would-be volunteers. Suddenly, needs shift and those interested in helping out have to adapt their strategies to fit with changing paradigms.</p>
<p>99% Invisible producer Katie Mingle had already been working on a series about unhoused people in the Bay Area for over a year when the current pandemic began to unfold. Suddenly, this vulnerable demographic was cast into the spotlight due to the virulent spread of COVID-19. It is clear from the data that this virus is hitting black and poor communities the hardest. COVID-19 has made American society’s racial and wealth inequities even more obvious. The disease is most dangerous to older and immunocompromised people, two groups to which those experiencing homelessness disproportionately belong.  <a href="https://endhomelessness.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/COVID-paper_clean-636pm.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A study</a> from a team of researchers at the University of Pennsylvania and UCLA found that homeless people would be twice as likely to be hospitalized as the general population, two to four times as likely to require critical care, and two to three times as likely to die, if they contracted COVID-19.</p>
<p>All over the country, people are scrambling to prevent large scale outbreaks in homeless communities, particularly in some of the places where unhoused people are most visible — encampments and shelters — where social distancing is nearly impossible. Cities and activists are exploring dynamic solutions that are still in flux, ranging from temporary hand-washing stations erected at homeless encampments to ad hoc quarantine rooms in hotels and convention centers.
</p>
<h2>Emergency Operation Centers</h2>
<p>Jen Loving is the CEO of an organization called <a href="https://destinationhomesv.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Destination Home</a> that works on both ending and preventing homelessness in Santa Clara County. Loving has worked in homeless services for over 20 years, and her organization has been around since 2008, but in light of the pandemic, everything changed. Destination Home was enlisted into a chain of command emergency response system called the Emergency Operations Center (EOC). Every county in California has one. An EOC typically takes control of all crisis responses in the event of an earthquake, or a flood, such as coordinating the deployment of food, shelter, and medical supplies — but this is the first time in Loving’s career that the EOC was being activated for a pandemic.</p>
<p>With the EOC serving as the primary disaster resources liaison to the state and federal government, Loving has observed a drastic shift in how homelessness services usually work in her county. She has been opening mass shelters to create space for more social distancing as well as facilitating the distribution of sanitation supplies. Her organization also raised an $11 million financial assistance fund to distribute to people in her county who have lost employment due to COVID-19 and are at risk of becoming homeless. Within three days of launching the fund, they received 1400 applications, pouring in so fast they crashed the organization’s server. Loving estimates that they’ll need about $100 million more for their fund just to keep people in Santa Clara County housed and fed right now. Funding is also just one part of a larger challenge in these difficult times.</p>
<p>For the most part, homeless services across the county come largely from nonprofit organizations and volunteer groups. As the crisis of homelessness collides with the crisis of the coronavirus, Destination Home as well as many other organizations are facing the sudden erosion of volunteer support. For the most part, inventories are shrinking. There are fewer hands available now that before. And this is drastically impacting the speed at which masks can be distributed, or the rate at which money from Jen’s $11 million fund can be doled out.</p>
<h2>Project Roomkey</h2>
<p>On April 3, Governor Gavin Newsom announced a plan to secure 15,000 <a href="https://charity.gofundme.com/o/en/campaign/hotel-rooms-for-the-homeless-sf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">hotel rooms across California for homeless people</a>. The project is a county-state partnership, where EOC’s at the county level and people like Jen Loving are making calls to hotel owners in the area and negotiating with them to rent rooms to the state at a reduced rate. But for California’s homeless population of at least 150,000, many activists are saying 15,000 hotel rooms isn’t nearly enough. In a state of emergency, the Governor and all Mayors have the authority to commandeer the use of private hotels and then work out a fair price later, in front of a judge. These activists have been calling on San Francisco’s Mayor London Breed to exercise that power and proactively commandeer hotels for the homeless in San Francisco.</p>
<h2>Worry On Top of Worry</h2>
<p>For unhoused persons, COVID-19 can feel like one additional thing to be worried about on top of poverty and daily survival, which are always more front-of-mind than the possibility of infection. A lot of the ways homeless people make money are not possible right now; some used to collect cans to sell at recycling centers, and those are mostly closed. Panhandling is more difficult.</p>
<p>In Berkeley, one particular camp has an extremely dedicated activist named Andrea Henson as it’s guardian. She’s raising money through a GoFundMe and handing out things like hand sanitizer and masks. Henson has been supporting this camp in many different ways since September 2018, but her role and involvement has changed since the arrival of COVID-19. With even more limited access to income than usual, many residents are increasingly at risk of going hungry, and Henson has been spending her mornings bagging food.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, there is new data coming out every day along with new challenges and potential solutions both in and beyond the Bay Area, both from the bottom up and the top down. For those working to make life better for unhoused populations, the target is ever-shifting.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Wipe Out]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you have tried to buy toilet paper in the last few weeks, you might have found yourself staring at an empty aisle in the grocery store, wondering where all the toilet paper has gone. Concerns over the toilet paper supply is not limited to the United States.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> In the Netherlands, a Dutch worker went viral after he filmed a video of himself zooming around a warehouse stacked to the rafters with toilet paper, laughing maniacally. </span></p>
<div class="video-container embed-container"><iframe title="On a Roll: Dutch Warehouse Worker Laughs With Glee as He Shows Off Toilet Paper Stock" width="267" height="200" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1pqXaVVmN-c?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Clearly, the world has been obsessed with toilet paper. Stephanie Joyce is a reporter based in Santa Fe, New Mexico, and she heard about a company in Albuquerque called <a href="https://www.rosessouthwestpapers.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Roses Southwest Papers</a>—which was relatively unknown before the fear of the COVID-19 virus pandemic began setting in. Roses normally sells to what is called the away from home paper market, meaning the toilet paper and paper towels you see in restaurants, sports stadiums and corporate campuses. But thanks to the pandemic, most people are using — and buying — exclusively at-home products.  That’s part of the reason there never seems to be enough on the shelves. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">So this March, in an effort to pivot to the at-home market, Roses began offering an option for the public to buy their paper directly from a kiosk at their warehouse. New Mexicans flocked to the kiosk in droves.</span></p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-31765" src="https://99percentinvisible.org/app/uploads/2020/04/Screen-Shot-2020-04-02-at-12.08.13-PM-600x613.png" alt width="600" height="613" srcset="https://99percentinvisible.org/app/uploads/2020/04/Screen-Shot-2020-04-02-at-12.08.13-PM-600x613.png 600w, https://99percentinvisible.org/app/uploads/2020/04/Screen-Shot-2020-04-02-at-12.08.13-PM-300x307.png 300w, https://99percentinvisible.org/app/uploads/2020/04/Screen-Shot-2020-04-02-at-12.08.13-PM-728x744.png 728w, https://99percentinvisible.org/app/uploads/2020/04/Screen-Shot-2020-04-02-at-12.08.13-PM.png 894w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Multiple lines of traffic extended in every direction, reaching lengths of nearly 3 mies. Some people had been waiting for hours—one person waiting in line actually had her daughter urinate out of the side of the car so that they wouldn’t lose their place in line in order to use the restroom. And these people waiting in a 3-mile long line to buy toilet paper aren’t hoarders, they simply could not find toilet paper anywhere else!</span></p>
<div class="video-container embed-container"><iframe title="Panic Buying at Costco" width="356" height="200" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vtcv24BacUA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although it may seem like a product that we’ve always been reliant upon, toilet paper has not actually been around very long, and may not be as essential as we think it is. Instead, it’s the product of very good marketing. For most of history, many would have thought it would be absurd to manufacture a product specifically for wiping after using the restroom because people used to use anything that was available.</span></p>

Instead, they would use rocks, shells, moss, or just plain water. </span>“The idea is you wet your hand with water and you use your left hand to clean your rear end, and then you wash your hand and then you rinse and repeat as they say,” Blumer explains. Apparently the Romans utilized a communal sponge on a stick, sitting in running water, to clean themselves. (which is not recommended by 99pi).</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In China, however, disposable toilet paper has been used for a very long time. China was where paper was actually invented and by the 1300s there were records of paper being made specifically for use in the toilet. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">By the 1600 intentionally disposable paper products  caught on around the rest of the world with the first newspapers. By the late 1700s making paper out of wood instead of rags became more prevalent, which meant paper became a whole lot cheaper, so people began to wipe with leftover paper products. But dedicated toilet paper had yet to catch on in western countries.  </span></p>
<h2>Wiping the Western World</h2>
<figure id="attachment_31769" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-31769" style="width: 293px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img class=" wp-image-31769" src="https://99percentinvisible.org/app/uploads/2020/04/joseph-gayetty-small.jpg" alt width="293" height="371" srcset="https://99percentinvisible.org/app/uploads/2020/04/joseph-gayetty-small.jpg 400w, https://99percentinvisible.org/app/uploads/2020/04/joseph-gayetty-small-300x380.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 293px) 100vw, 293px" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-31769" class="wp-caption-text">Joseph Gayetty</figcaption></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Blumer credits a man named <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Gayetty" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Joseph Gayetty</a> as the first person to actually sell toilet paper in the Western world. In the 1850s Gayetty made a pitch that using corncobs and old newspapers was actually bad for you. “He decided to make this a form of paper, which was thin, and sold it as [being] more gentle on your rear end,” says Blumer, “and presumably that had some connection with not hurting your delicate membranes and helping if you had hemorrhoids. But we probably wouldn’t recognize this toilet paper as the same kind we use today, it was probably closer to tissue paper, but it was thin and would get the job done.”</span></p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-31770" src="https://99percentinvisible.org/app/uploads/2020/04/GayettysMedicatedPaperAdvertisement.jpg" alt width="440" height="653" srcset="https://99percentinvisible.org/app/uploads/2020/04/GayettysMedicatedPaperAdvertisement.jpg 440w, https://99percentinvisible.org/app/uploads/2020/04/GayettysMedicatedPaperAdvertisement-300x445.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 440px) 100vw, 440px" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gayetty’s paper came in a box like tissues and was made of hemp. It wasn’t a very popular product because it was very expensive and only the rich could afford it. Most never saw the use for this paper anyway. But one other invention changed the need for Gayetty’s paper—indoor plumbing.</span></p>
<h2>Feeling Flushed</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Toilets were moving inside of houses and they were now being connected to sewer systems that flushed with water. But the problem was that indoor toilets were very finicky, and if you were going to flush with what you wiped with it had to be very delicate like Gayetty’s paper. Gayetty pivoted the marketing for his paper entirely, rather than focusing on health, he focused on the sensitivity of indoor plumbing. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But a competing businessman named Seth Wheeler is the one credited with creating toilet paper as we know it today — in a roll and with sheets.  “Wheeler came up with the idea of perforation first, and it wasn’t in connection with toilet paper—It was in connection with wrapping paper.” Blumer explains. “He thought that it would be very convenient for stores to be able to pull off a sheet of paper and rip it along a perforation.”</span></p>

<p></p></div>
<p> </p>
<p>Wheeler would go on to patent all sorts of toilet paper-related innovations, some more sensible than others, including a role with hexagonal sheets, which he thought would be easier to tear.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-31786" src="https://99percentinvisible.org/app/uploads/2020/04/US361603-drawings-page-3-600x881.png" alt width="433" height="636" srcset="https://99percentinvisible.org/app/uploads/2020/04/US361603-drawings-page-3-600x881.png 600w, https://99percentinvisible.org/app/uploads/2020/04/US361603-drawings-page-3-300x441.png 300w, https://99percentinvisible.org/app/uploads/2020/04/US361603-drawings-page-3-728x1069.png 728w" sizes="(max-width: 433px) 100vw, 433px" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">But it was yet another competitor that turned toilet paper a ubiquitous household item—the Scott Paper Company—the very same one we see on shelves today. Scott started making toilet paper around the same time as Wheeler, but they had a lot better marketing. They actually took Gayetty’s original strategy as toilet paper as the solution to hemorrhoids but did it better by putting doctors in their ads and saying that other brands had wood chips and splinters in their product. Meanwhile, they played up their own paper as delicate and dainty. And it worked! Scott ended up owning the market share of the industry throughout the 1950s.</span></p>

<h2>Billion Dollar Wipes</h2>
<p><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-31771" src="https://99percentinvisible.org/app/uploads/2020/04/toilet-paper-3964492_1920-600x398.jpg" alt width="600" height="398" srcset="https://99percentinvisible.org/app/uploads/2020/04/toilet-paper-3964492_1920-600x398.jpg 600w, https://99percentinvisible.org/app/uploads/2020/04/toilet-paper-3964492_1920-300x199.jpg 300w, https://99percentinvisible.org/app/uploads/2020/04/toilet-paper-3964492_1920-728x482.jpg 728w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now toilet paper is a $31 billion industry. With people fighting over toilet paper packages in supermarkets and queuing up for hours to buy supply, it probably feels like there’s a shortage of bath tissue. But we probably aren’t in danger of running out of it in the long run. Unlike a lot of other products, most of the toilet paper supply chain is entirely in the US or North America, so manufacturing hasn’t shut down at all, and people are not consuming any more toilet paper than usual. The bottleneck lies in the difference between how quickly people are buying it in stores and how much production can be ramped up. </span>The other reason for the shortage is that away-from-home suppliers like Roses –that normally sell to larger, institutional clients — need time to arrange contracts and shipments to stores that sell directly to consumers.  <span style="font-weight: 400;">There is a limit to how fast they can pivot, and how quickly their machines can actually run, but eventually, the supply should be able to catch up to demand. </span>In the meantime, there’s always Roses’s factory kiosk…</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">… or water. Somewhere around 70% of the world still uses water instead of toilet paper, and for good reason. Some studies have actually shown that toilet paper isn’t as sanitary as we think it is and does very little to protect us from bacteria as opposed to water and, unlike Galetty claimed, toilet paper is not good for the treatment of hemorrhoids.  When it comes down to it, toilet paper isn’t necessarily that essential of a product. It’s something humans have lived without for thousands of years. But if it brings people comfort to have in this extraordinary situation, by all means, go buy it. Just make sure to wash your hands!</span></p>

            <title><![CDATA[This is Chance! Redux]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>It was the middle of the night on March 27, 1964. Earlier that evening, the second-biggest earthquake ever measured at the time had hit Anchorage, Alaska. 115 people died. Some houses had been turned completely upside down while others had skidded into the sea. But that brief and catastrophic quake was just the <a href="https://amzn.to/2U1flDE" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">beginning of the story</a>.</p>
<figure id="attachment_19481" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-19481" style="width: 600px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="https://99percentinvisible.org/app/uploads/2017/05/alaska-quake.jpg" class="media-img"><img class="wp-image-19481 size-medium" src="https://99percentinvisible.org/app/uploads/2017/05/alaska-quake-600x429.jpg" alt width="600" height="429" srcset="https://99percentinvisible.org/app/uploads/2017/05/alaska-quake-600x429.jpg 600w, https://99percentinvisible.org/app/uploads/2017/05/alaska-quake-300x214.jpg 300w, https://99percentinvisible.org/app/uploads/2017/05/alaska-quake-728x520.jpg 728w, https://99percentinvisible.org/app/uploads/2017/05/alaska-quake.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-19481" class="wp-caption-text">The largest landslide in Anchorage occurred between Point Woronzof and Fish Creek</figcaption></figure>
<p>There was no light or power in the city — and for a long time, virtually no communication with the outside world. But there was one signal making it out of the devastated area. Running on backup generators and a cracked transmitter, a radio station in Anchorage continued to broadcast. Then a station in Fairbanks picked up that signal and repeated it. A man in Juneau picked up that Fairbanks station, called a radio station in Seattle and let the broadcast play over his phone. The president of that Anchorage radio station happened to be on a goodwill tour of Japan. And when he turned on a radio in Tokyo, he couldn’t believe what he was hearing — it was the voice of his own “newsgirl” back home, a woman by the name of Genie Chance.</p>
